# AstroMorph 🚀🌌

AstroMorph is a modular astrophotography enhancement toolkit, built for precision, speed, and experimentation. It empowers amateur and advanced imagers alike to extract maximum detail from deep-sky captures through entropy sharpening, Gaussian centroiding, radial FWHM mapping, and layered post-processing.

## Features
- 🔍 **Entropy-Based Sharpening** – Enhance local contrast without blowing out stellar cores.
- 🎯 **Gaussian Localization** – Sub-pixel centroiding with dynamic weighting.
- 🌐 **Radial FWHM Estimator** – Diagnose field curvature and guide focus corrections.
- 🖼 **Layered Processing Pipeline** – Multi-band blending of detail, contrast, and base signal.
- 🧪 **JupyterLab Notebook Support** – Prototype, visualize, and iterate in real time.
- 🐳 **Dockerized Environment** – Fully containerized for reproducibility across platforms.
